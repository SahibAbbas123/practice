# What's This About
Regardless of how embarassingly old I am to start learning such a basic skill, here my journey starts as I use git+gitHub for the first time. I fully intend to make mistakes (yes, embarassing ones) and learn from those. Insha allah I will be able to make much use of git and github and someday say, "Kire egula to onek easy chilo!"
